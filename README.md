# Fantasy General Conference

[My Notes](notes.md)

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

- [x] Description of key features in your README.md

### Elevator pitch

I have enjoyed listening to the messages of General Conference, but I also love to guess where temples will be announced. This has become a family friendly prediction competition! The goal of the game is to have the highest score by predicting who will speak and when, where temples are announced, tie colors, and a few other topics. To make it easier to play with friends in different places, this will allow anyone to login, select their predictions, and watch their results compete with others during the sessions. My hope is to make this program simple and enjoyable! A game that's light-hearted, fun, and invites others to tune into the messages of General Conference!

### Design

![FGC_Design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2f2a4aa-9973-47ff-9460-10e4732e3f69)

Here are three drawings that depict the three main pages of the program. The left-most illustration is the **Login** page. The middle illustration is the **Prediction** page. The right-most illustration is the **Scoreboard** page.  

**Login**  

This page includes boxes to input a username and email. There is also a space for text/image displaying the title.  

**Prediction**  

This page contains a group of categories and interactive boxes or menus to select answers and set predictions. There are also a few buttons which allow for selecting different pages and locking a user's answers.  

**Scoreboard**  

This page updates as answers and scores are submitted. The page displays the user with their score in comparison with other participating users.

    Website -->>Michael: Joshua +3 point(s)
    Michael->>Website: Michael +1 point(s)
    Website -->>Joshua: Michael +1 point(s)
```

### Key features

- Page for registering or login 
- Ability to select user answers for their prediction
- Ability to alter predictions
- Ability for user to lock prediction
- Scoreboard of users and their scores
- Admin can access and input the correct answers

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses HTML to provide a simple structure to the needed pages. A few HTML pages will be used for the login, predictions, and scoreboard pages.
- **CSS** - Uses CSS to improve the visual design and apply color to the display.
- **React** - A page containing components that are reactive to the user and their prediction input.
- **Service** - The backend service provides prediction options and retrieves the user's selection.
- **DB/Login** - Users register and login before they can fill out their predicitons. User information and predictions are safely stored in a database.
- **WebSocket** - As each user inputs their predictions, their scores are broadcasted to other users in the form of a scoreboard.
